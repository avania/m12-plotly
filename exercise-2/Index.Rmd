This is an example of annotating, from plotly's website
```{r, echo=FALSE}

library(plotly)

m <- mtcars[which.max(mtcars$mpg), ]

a <- list(
  x = m$wt,
  y = m$mpg,
  text = rownames(m),
  xref = "x",
  yref = "y",
  showarrow = TRUE,
  arrowhead = 7,
  ax = 20,
  ay = -40
)

plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg) %>%
  add_markers() %>%
  layout(annotations = a)
```
